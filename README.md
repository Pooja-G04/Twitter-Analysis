# Indian-Flights-Delay-Prediction
Twitter sentiment and its direct correlation and/or anti-correlation
to features such as delay in flights, increase in cost of travel, a recently
happened political event etc may be used to obtain indirect
correlation/anti-correlation between the above said features and
thus make predictions regarding these quantities. As a first step to
this idea, in this project, we demonstrate that flight delay predictions
of a particular airline, say, Indigo, can be augmented by the
Twitter data which is shown to be correlated to delay data. We use
Random Forest Regressor to make delay predictions and draw a
comparison between Twitter-less model performance and Twitteraugmented
model performance.We find that the mean square error
metric used to define loss in a machine learning regressor reduces
when the model is trained on twitter-augmented data. The reduction
even though minor strengthens our initial idea of using Twitter
features to make invaluable predictions concerning the aviation
industry
